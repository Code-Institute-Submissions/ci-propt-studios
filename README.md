### User stories

As a prospective client, I want to see what this gym offers, what do people say about it and who are the trainers.

As a prospective and current client, I wish to be able to view the time table and book a slot online. 

As a potential client I want to contact the team because I have some additional questions.

### Strategy

The main design goal is to make important information accesible to new/existing clients while mainataining clean and modern look.

### Scope

For the prospective clients, website offers insight into what the gym offers & who the trainers are. For the existing clietns, the website offers information about the classes & offers curretnly avaialable.

### Structure

Home page displays key 'features' of the gym under the 'What we offer' section.
This is followed by the testemonials of those that are current gym goers.
After which the user can see who the trainers are and finally where the gym is located. 

Classes & timetable offers the user a overwiew of classes the gym currently does as well as the timetable for the week. Below this, the user can read frequently asked questions & their answers.

## Features


### Existing Features

ProPT studios, until now, did not have a website, so there were no existing fetures.

Marketing and client updates were provided through social media such as Facebook.

### Features Left to Implement

The idea is to implement a back-end for scheduling clients & bookings at a later date.

The Contact us form curretnly has no action, no email gets sent after the button is clicked. The idea is to implement automatic email sending to trainer's emails after the user submits the form.
